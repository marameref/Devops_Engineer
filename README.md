### Azure Functions: A Beginner’s Guide to Serverless Computing with Visual Studio Code
[Publication]([https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240](https://medium.com/@marameref/azure-functions-a-beginners-guide-to-serverless-computing-with-visual-studio-code-cdd60ff02965)

Azure Functions, a powerful serverless computing service provided by Microsoft Azure, offers an ideal solution for building and running applications in the cloud. This beginner-friendly guide will walk you through what Azure Functions is, its applications, and why it may be a preferred choice over Azure Apps. Furthermore, we will provide a step-by-step process for creating Azure Functions (using Visual Studio Code), deploying them to the Azure cloud, as well as how to troubleshoot and resolve top 5 most common issues cloud developers often encounter in this process.

The Unicorn Engine repository maintainers had a specific request: to create a CI workflow that would automatically attach builds to releases. This request was my introduction to GitHub Actions. While I had read about it in the past, I had never delved into it. To say that I had “cold feet” is an understatement; I was diving headfirst into uncharted territory.
